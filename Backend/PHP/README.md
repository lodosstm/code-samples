# Samples of PHP

## First sample

There is a code sample of PHP framework - Laravel. 

There are several files with code:
* [API for plan identity](sample1/api_plans.php)
* [Event controller](sample1/EventController.php)
* [Home controller](sample1/HomeController.php)
* [Plan model](sample1/plan.php)
* [Plan controller](sample1/plans.php)
* [User model](sample1/User.php)
* [User controller](sample1/UserController.php)

This code has 2 identities: user and plan. Each identity has a contoller and model. Also there are examples of 2 controllers - Home and Event.
